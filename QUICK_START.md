![Application Features](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300/e0e0e0/666666?text=Application+Features)

1. **Shuffle Mode**: Click "ðŸ”€ Shuffle" to randomize the order of cards (click again to return to ordered mode)
2. **Language Direction**: Click "ðŸ”„ Source â†’ Target" to switch between source language first and target language first

## Tips for Effective Learning

- **Review regularly**: Short, frequent sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones
- **Say words aloud**: Pronounce each word as you see it
- **Use both modes**: Practice with both Sourceâ†’Target and Targetâ†’Source directions
- **Write it down**: For better retention, try writing down the translations

## Troubleshooting

- **Cards not loading?** Check your internet connection
- **Audio not playing?** Some words may not have associated audio files
- **Page not displaying correctly?** Try refreshing or using a different browser

## Creating Your Own Flashcards

To use your own vocabulary list:

1. Create a Google Spreadsheet with:
   - Header row containing language names (e.g., "English", "French")
   - Data rows with columns for:
     - Source language word
     - Source language audio URL (optional)
     - Target language translation
     - Target language audio URL (optional)
2. Make the spreadsheet publicly accessible
3. Update the application code with your spreadsheet ID

Alternatively, you can use URL parameters:
```
https://apostx.github.io/language-flashcard/?spreadsheetId=YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID&sheetId=0
```

## Advanced Features

- **Debug Mode**: Add `?debug=true` (or simply `?debug`) to the URL to show debug information
- **Custom Spreadsheet**: Use `?spreadsheetId=YOUR_ID&sheetId=0` to specify a different data source

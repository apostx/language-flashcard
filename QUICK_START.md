## Tips for Effective Learning

- **Review regularly**: Short, frequent sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones
- **Say words aloud**: Pronounce each word as you see it

- **Write it down**: For better retention, try writing down the translations

## Troubleshooting

- **Cards not loading?** Check your internet connection
- **Audio not playing?** Some words may not have associated audio files
- **Page not displaying correctly?** Try refreshing or using a different browser

   - German audio URL (optional)

   - Hungarian audio URL (optional)
2. Make the spreadsheet publicly accessible

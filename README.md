## AI-Generated Project

This project was created with the assistance of Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic. The development process was guided by:

- **AI Model**: Claude 3.7
- **Generation Date**: June 2025
- **Development Approach**: Iterative dialogue between human and AI to specify requirements, generate code, and refine implementation

The AI was used to:
- Generate the initial project structure
- Write component code with TypeScript
- Implement CSS styling for the UI
- Develop the data fetching service
- Create documentation and testing

Human oversight and direction were provided throughout the development process to ensure the application meets quality standards and follows best practices.

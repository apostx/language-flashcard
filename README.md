## Data Structure

The application fetches data from a Google Spreadsheet with the following structure:

1. **Header Row**: First row should contain language names (e.g., "English", "Spanish")
2. **Content Rows**:
   - Column 1: Source language word (required)
   - Column 2: URL to source language pronunciation audio (optional)
   - Column 3: Target language translation (required)
   - Column 4: URL to target language pronunciation audio (optional)

### Custom Data Source

To use your own Google Spreadsheet:

1. Create a spreadsheet with the structure above
2. Make the spreadsheet publicly accessible (File â†’ Share â†’ Anyone with the link â†’ Viewer)
3. You can specify your spreadsheet using URL query parameters:
   - `?spreadsheetId=YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID` - Replace with your spreadsheet ID
   - `?sheetId=0` - Specify which sheet to use (default is 0, the first sheet)
   - Example: `https://apostx.github.io/language-flashcard/?spreadsheetId=1abc123&sheetId=2`

### URL Parameters

The application supports the following URL parameters:

- `spreadsheetId` - Specify a custom Google Spreadsheet ID
- `sheetId` - Specify which sheet to use (default is 0)
- `debug` - Enable debug mode to see detailed information (`?debug=true` or simply `?debug`). Debug information is always hidden by default, regardless of environment.

Alternatively, you can update the `DEFAULT_SPREADSHEET_ID` constant in `src/services/spreadsheetService.ts` with your spreadsheet ID.

### Debug Mode

You can enable debug information display by adding `?debug=true` to the URL.
Example: `https://apostx.github.io/language-flashcard/?debug=true`

## AI-Generated Project

This project was created with the assistance of Claude, an AI assistant by Anthropic. The development process was guided by:

- **AI Model**: Claude 3.7
- **Generation Date**: June 2025
- **Development Approach**: Iterative dialogue between human and AI to specify requirements, generate code, and refine implementation

The AI was used to:
- Generate the initial project structure
- Write component code with TypeScript
- Implement CSS styling for the UI
- Develop the data fetching service
- Create documentation and testing

Human oversight and direction were provided throughout the development process to ensure the application meets quality standards and follows best practices.
